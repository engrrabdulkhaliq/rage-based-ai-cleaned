[40:00 - 40:07] count. For that we can use the count method of tuple. Let's try to recreate this tuple.
[40:07 - 40:13] We will call it grade and to create tuple we will put parentheses. We will copy our
[40:13 - 40:24] grades. First C is coming then D is coming. Then we have A, another A, B, another B and
[40:24 - 40:34] finally A. We can simply print grade.count .
[40:34 - 40:38] Save and run. In the answer we have the value 3k.
[40:38 - 40:44] Next question is, store the above values in a list and sort them from A to D.
[40:44 - 40:51] That means first we have to create the same values in the form of a list and then we have
[40:51 - 40:55] we have to sort from A to D. What does A to D mean?
[40:55 - 40:58] A to D means ascending order.
[40:58 - 41:02] Means small character first and big character later.
[41:02 - 41:07] So here we can create a list for this using our square brackets.
[41:07 - 41:12] And we can write grade dot or simply grade dot sort.
[41:12 - 41:17] And then we will print our grade.
[41:17 - 41:20] Let's save it and run it.
[41:20 - 41:21] What are the values?
[41:21 - 41:25] The values are now arranged in sorted order from A to D.
[41:25 - 41:30] So, in this way we work in Python with list and tuples.
[41:30 - 41:34] So, I hope that in today's lecture we would have enjoyed reading more new concepts in Python.
[41:34 - 41:39] And the notes of today's lecture, the slides, you will find them in the description box below.
[41:39 - 41:41] We can access them from there.
[41:41 - 41:42] See you in the next lecture.
[41:42 - 41:44] Till then keep learning and keep practicing.
